## VB Code Block Example

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph Before VB Code in Markdown}}
Below is a sample of a VB class that implements a simple calculator functionality. It includes XML comments and follows modern standards for clarity.

```[ListingType]
{{codetype:vb}}
{{filename:MyAceMod.vb}}
Public Class Calculator
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Adds two integers.
    ''' </summary>
    Public Function Add(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer
        Return a + b
    End Function
End Class
```
{{summary: Simple VB Calculator class implementing an Add method}}

## C# Code Block Example

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph Before C# Code in Markdown}}
Now, take a look at the following C# example. This sample code defines a calculator class with a multiplication method using expression-bodied members.

```[ListingType]
{{codetype:c#}}
{{filename:Calculator.cs}}
/// <summary>
/// Provides calculation functionality.
/// </summary>
public class Calculator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Multiplies two integers.
    /// </summary>
    public int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
}
```
{{summary: Simple C# Calculator class with a Multiply method}}

## Plain-Text Code Block with Cascaded Markdown Formatting

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph Before Plain-Text Code in Markdown}}
The following code block is a plain-text snippet that itself contains Markdown formatting. It shows how nested Markdown structures look when rendered.

```[ListingType]
{{codetype:plaintext}}
{{filename:NestedMarkdown.txt}}
# This is a Header inside a Plain-Text Block

- **Bold Item:** This item is emphasized.
- *Italic Item:* This item is styled in italics.
- `Inline Code:` This represents a code snippet.
```

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph After Plain-text Code in Markdown}}
Such nested formatting can be particularly useful when documenting content that requires demonstration of raw Markdown syntax.

{{md-description: Batch Script Code Block Section Header in Markdown}}
## Batch Script Code Block Example

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph Before Batch Script Code in Markdown}}
Below is an example of a Batch script, which simply prints a greeting and waits for key press before terminating.

```[ListingType]
{{codetype:batch}}
{{filename:Greeting.bat}}
@echo off
REM This batch script displays a greeting message.
echo Hello World!
pause
```
{{summary: Batch script printing 'Hello World!' and pausing execution}}

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph After Batch Script Code in Markdown}}
This example illustrates a minimal batch file that can be expanded upon for more complex Windows scripting tasks.

## Python Code Block Example

{{md-description: Explanatory Paragraph Before Python Code in Markdown}}
Lastly, here is a brief Python snippet. This code defines a simple greeting function with type hints and documentation, following modern Python conventions.

```[ListingType]
{{codetype:python}}
{{filename:greet.py}}
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    """Greets a person by name."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("Alice")
```
