## 20 Seconds Elevator Pitch as Introduction

Hey everyone, so this will be a quick overview of what we would think 
of as a CommunityToolkit for WinForms.

Although you'll see your typical Chat-App in this demo, 
this is not about this Chatty App (is what I called it).

The purpose of this set of libraries is aimed at WinForms and WPF, maybe even WinUI, 
to modernize existing huge Line-of-Business applications, 
and to make it easier to integrate AI and LLM.

I started this project after the MVP Summit last year. 
I had a really long chat with a friend of mine, Markus Egger, most of you know him - he is the guy owning Code Magazine. 
He went all in at that time and retrofitted their own internal CRM system with AI. 
He was super excited about it but also mentioned that the support to retrofit AI 
in those systems is just a nightmare. So, that was how this side-project started.

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Thank you for joining me today. 
In this video, I'll be showcasing the CommunityToolkit.WinForms, 
a collection of tools and components aimed at modernizing WinForms applications. 
Whether you're looking to integrate AI, improve performance, 
or adopt modern development practices, this toolkit has something for you.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.AI (30 seconds)

First up, we have `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.AI`. 
This component simplifies the integration of AI and LLMs into your WinForms applications. 
With easy-to-use components, you can quickly develop tools for learning, exploring, 
and prototyping AI technologies. 
It also provides a feasible adoption path for integrating AI into large-scale Line-of-Business applications.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.AsyncSupport (30 seconds)

Next, we have `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.AsyncSupport`. 
This component ensures compatibility with modern development stacks 
by incorporating XAML-based architecture patterns like MVVM. 
It also provides alternatives to legacy WinForms technologies, 
enabling Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and integrating Blazor-based UI components.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.ComponentModel (30 seconds)

`CommunityToolkit.WinForms.ComponentModel` facilitates AI-powered auto-migration. 
It includes tools and frameworks needed for automatic or semi-automatic modernization processes, 
such as the Upgrade Assistant. 
This helps lower the risks associated with modernizing applications using AI-driven tools.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Controls.ConsoleControl (30 seconds)

The `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Controls.ConsoleControl` modernizes rendering performance and accessibility. 
It addresses rendering issues caused by GDI/GDI+ on newer graphics cards 
and introduces performant and accessible rendering solutions using Direct2D/DirectWrite. 
This component leverages AI-assisted approaches to create role-model projects demonstrating these modernized techniques.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.ConversationView (30 seconds)

`CommunityToolkit.WinForms.ConversationView` enhances communication interfaces 
by providing a conversation view control for chat and interactive communication. 
This makes it easy to create chatbots and integrate seamlessly with AI and chatbot services.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.DesktopGeneric.Mvvm (30 seconds)

`CommunityToolkit.WinForms.DesktopGeneric.Mvvm` offers MVVM support for WinForms applications. 
It promotes a clean separation of concerns, improving the maintainability and testability of your applications.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Extensions.FormAndControlExtensions (30 seconds)

`CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Extensions.FormAndControlExtensions` extends the functionality of WinForms forms and controls. 
It provides various extensions that enhance the usability of standard WinForms components, 
simplifying development with extended features.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.FluentUI (30 seconds)

`CommunityToolkit.WinForms.FluentUI` introduces Fluent UI design elements to WinForms applications. 
This modernizes the look and feel of your applications, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing UI.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Mvvm (30 seconds)

`CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Mvvm` provides additional MVVM utilities and components tailored specifically for WinForms applications. 
It simplifies the implementation of the MVVM pattern, making it easier to develop maintainable and testable applications.

## CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Roslyn (30 seconds)

Finally, `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Roslyn` leverages the Roslyn compiler platform for advanced code analysis and refactoring. 
It provides tools to improve code quality and maintainability, helping you write better code.

## Conclusion (30 seconds)

In conclusion, the CommunityToolkit.WinForms offers a comprehensive set of tools and components 
to modernize and enhance your WinForms applications. 
Whether you're integrating AI, improving performance, or adopting modern development practices, 
this toolkit has you covered. 
Thank you for watching, and I hope you find these tools as valuable as I do.

## Background Information (Optional)

For those interested in the background, I started this project in April 2024, 
mostly as a side project in my own time, because I did not have a fully supported mandate for it. 
The idea came after a conversation with Markus Egger, CEO of CodeMagazine, 
a very important developer magazine. 
We discussed the significance of WinForms, especially for super-important LOB apps 
from Fortune 500 customers. 
We concluded that it would be a missed opportunity not to retrofit AI functionality 
into these applications. 
This would benefit customers, their users, and Microsoft by contributing to the revenue stream 
and making a significant impact.
