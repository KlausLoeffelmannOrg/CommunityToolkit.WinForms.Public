# CommunityToolkit.WinForms
**WinForms specific Toolkit and Component collection for Modernizing and Enhancing WinForms Development and introduce AI and LLM features into WinForms LOB-Apps.**

## Key Objectives

### 1. Simplifying AI and LLM Integration into WinForms
- **Provide easy-to-use, WinForms-typical components for AI and LLMs:**
  - Offer customers a platform to rapidly develop tools for learning, exploring, and prototyping technologies based on AI and LLMs.
  - Enable customers to iteratively implement AI, LLMs, and agents into their existing, large-scale Line-of-Business (LOB) WinForms applications, providing a feasible adoption path for both their applications and teams.
  - Give developers an easy way to quickly create custom tools that enhance and simplify workflows, similar to how macros improved Word and Excel workflows in the early 1990s.

### 2. Ensuring Compatibility with Existing Stacks
- **Support modern architecture and development approaches:**
  - Incorporate XAML-based architecture patterns like MVVM.
  - Provide alternatives to legacy WinForms technologies that prevent Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.
  - Integrate Blazor-based UI components to extend and modernize existing WinForms applications.

### 3. Facilitating AI-Powered Auto-Migration
- **Develop infrastructure to support automatic or semi-automatic modernization:**
  - Build tools and frameworks needed for auto-migration processes, such as the Upgrade Assistant.
  - Lower risks associated with modernizing applications using AI- or agent-driven tools.

### 4. Improving Rendering Performance and Accessibility
- **Modernize rendering pipelines for better performance and compatibility:**
  - Address serious rendering issues caused by GDI/GDI+ on newer graphics cards.
  - Introduce performant and accessible rendering solutions using Direct2D/DirectWrite.
  - Leverage AI-assisted approaches to create role-model projects demonstrating these modernized techniques.

### 5. Updating and Expanding Templates
- **Revitalize outdated project templates:**
  - Replace obsolete code in existing templates, ensuring compliance with modern standards.
  - Provide "Get Started" solution templates tailored to various scenarios to help customers quickly transition to modern workflows.
- **Expand project template offerings to cover important use cases:**
  - Windows Services.
  - Custom developer tools based on Roslyn with specialized WinForms UIs.
  - System Tray applications.
  - Scaffolds for LOB applications utilizing Azure features like:
    - Web APIs.
    - SignalR.
    - Azure Functions.
    - Microsoft Graph.
