# CommunityToolkit.WinForms
**WinForms specific Toolkit and Component collection for Modernizing and Enhancing 
WinForms Development and introduce AI and LLM features into WinForms LOB-Apps.**

## API areas with their Key Objectives

### 1. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.AI`: Simplifying AI and LLM Integration into WinForms
* Provide easy-to-use, WinForms-typical components for AI and LLMs:
  - Offer customers a platform to rapidly develop tools for learning, exploring, and prototyping technologies based on AI and LLMs.
  - Enable customers to iteratively implement AI, LLMs, and agents into their existing, large-scale Line-of-Business (LOB) WinForms applications, providing a feasible adoption path for both their applications and teams.
  - Give developers an easy way to quickly create custom tools that enhance and simplify workflows, similar to how macros improved Word and Excel workflows in the early 1990s.

### 2. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.AsyncSupport`: Ensuring Compatibility with Existing Stacks
* Support modern architecture and development approaches:
  - Incorporate XAML-based architecture patterns like MVVM.
  - Provide alternatives to legacy WinForms technologies that prevent Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.
  - Integrate Blazor-based UI components to extend and modernize existing WinForms applications.

### 3. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.ComponentModel`: Facilitating AI-Powered Auto-Migration
* Develop infrastructure to support automatic or semi-automatic modernization:
  - Build tools and frameworks needed for auto-migration processes, such as the Upgrade Assistant.
  - Lower risks associated with modernizing applications using AI- or agent-driven tools.

### 4. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Controls.ConsoleControl`: Improving Rendering Performance and Accessibility
* Modernize rendering pipelines for better performance and compatibility:
  - Address serious rendering issues caused by GDI/GDI+ on newer graphics cards.
  - Introduce performant and accessible rendering solutions using Direct2D/DirectWrite.
  - Leverage AI-assisted approaches to create role-model projects demonstrating these modernized techniques.

### 5. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.ConversationView`: Enhancing Communication Interfaces
* Provide conversation view control for chat and interactive communication:
  - Facilitate the creation of chatbots and interactive communication features.
  - Integrate seamlessly with AI and chatbot services.

### 6. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.DesktopGeneric.Mvvm`: Implementing MVVM Pattern
* Offer MVVM support for WinForms applications:
  - Promote a clean separation of concerns.
  - Improve maintainability and testability of applications.

### 7. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Extensions.FormAndControlExtensions`: Extending Form and Control Functionality
* Provide various extensions for WinForms forms and controls:
  - Enhance the functionality and usability of standard WinForms components.
  - Simplify development with extended features.

### 8. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.FluentUI`: Modernizing UI Design
* Introduce Fluent UI design elements to WinForms applications:
  - Modernize the look and feel of applications.
  - Ensure consistent and visually appealing UI.

### 9. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Mvvm`: Additional MVVM Support
* Provide additional MVVM utilities and components:
  - Tailored specifically for WinForms applications.
  - Simplify the implementation of the MVVM pattern.

### 10. `CommunityToolkit.WinForms.Roslyn`: Advanced Code Analysis and Refactoring
* Leverage the Roslyn compiler platform for code analysis:
  - Provide advanced code analysis and refactoring tools.
  - Improve code quality and maintainability.
