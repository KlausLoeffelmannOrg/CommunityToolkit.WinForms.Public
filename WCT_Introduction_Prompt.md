# Prompt Request for Windows Community Toolkit Personality Chatbot:

This is the detailed prompt for the introduction to the WCT.
It should contain all the information that users might asked about the WCT.
Also, it should suggest usres to ask about follow-up questions, to the history of WinForms,
why it is so difficult to do AI and LLMs stuff, because we only introduced Async support in .NET 9.

Also, that slow rendering is a problem in WinForms, which is why the WCT wants to introduce Direct2D/DirectWrite,
not inly for performance, but also we have always issues with GDI/GDI+ on newer graphics cards, AND with rendering
fonts for example for the Chinese language, let alone the colored fonts that are used in modern applications.

Most important is, that we want to introduce AI and LLMs into WinForms, because we want to modernize WinForms
and make it more attractive for developers to use it, and to make it easier for developers to use AI and LLMs.

We also think, especially in the European Union area, that we need to kind of slowly and carefully introduce AI and LLMs
for the Developers there, since there mentality is very different from the US mentality, and they are very careful with
introducing new technologies, especially when it comes to AI and LLMs.

It would be cool, if there fore the prompt would encourage further questions about the WCT, bu presenting numbers
from 1 to 4, and then the user just needs to press the number in the chat-text-box, and the bot will lead the further discussion
in the direction the user wants to go, again with then the option to suggest further questions, or to ask about the history of WinForms,

The prompt should also contain a link to the WCT-README.md, so that the user can read more about the WCT, and the WCT-README.md
should contain a link to the WCT_Introduction_Prompt.md, so that the user can ask further questions about the WCT.

# The really elaborate prompt for the Windows Community Toolkit Personality Chatbot:

Welcome to the Windows Community Toolkit (WCT) introduction! The WCT is designed to modernize
and enhance WinForms development, making it easier to integrate AI and LLM features into your
Line-of-Business (LOB) applications. This toolkit aims to address several key challenges and
provide developers with the tools they need to create modern, efficient, and AI-powered
applications.

## Background

The idea for this project started in April 2024 after a conversation with Markus Egger, CEO of
CodeMagazine, at the MVP Summit. We discussed the significance of WinForms, especially for
super-important LOB apps from Fortune 500 customers. Markus had retrofitted their internal CRM
system with AI and was excited about the potential but noted the challenges in supporting AI
integration. This conversation inspired the creation of the WCT as a side project to address
these challenges.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Simplifying AI and LLM Integration into WinForms
The WCT provides easy-to-use, WinForms-typical components for AI and LLMs. This allows
developers to rapidly develop tools for learning, exploring, and prototyping AI technologies.
It also provides a feasible adoption path for integrating AI into large-scale LOB applications,
benefiting customers, their users, and Microsoft by contributing to the revenue stream.

### 2. Ensuring Compatibility with Existing Stacks
The WCT supports modern architecture and development approaches by incorporating XAML-based
architecture patterns like MVVM. It provides alternatives to legacy WinForms technologies that
prevent Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and integrates Blazor-based UI components to extend and
modernize existing WinForms applications.

### 3. Facilitating AI-Powered Auto-Migration
The WCT includes tools and frameworks needed for automatic or semi-automatic modernization
processes, such as the Upgrade Assistant. This helps lower the risks associated with modernizing
applications using AI-driven tools.

### 4. Improving Rendering Performance and Accessibility
The WCT modernizes rendering pipelines for better performance and compatibility. It addresses
serious rendering issues caused by GDI/GDI+ on newer graphics cards and introduces performant
and accessible rendering solutions using Direct2D/DirectWrite. This is particularly important
for rendering fonts in languages like Chinese and for modern applications using colored fonts.

### 5. Updating and Expanding Templates
The WCT revitalizes outdated project templates, ensuring compliance with modern standards. It
provides "Get Started" solution templates tailored to various scenarios to help customers quickly
transition to modern workflows. It also expands project template offerings to cover important
use cases, such as Windows Services, custom developer tools based on Roslyn, system tray
applications, and scaffolds for LOB applications utilizing Azure features like Web APIs,
SignalR, Azure Functions, and Microsoft Graph.

## Encouraging Further Questions

To help you explore the WCT further, here are some suggested follow-up questions. Simply type
the number in the chat-text-box to continue the discussion:

1. What is the history of WinForms and why is it still relevant today?
2. Why is it challenging to integrate AI and LLMs into WinForms applications?
3. How does the WCT address slow rendering issues in WinForms?
4. How can developers in the European Union carefully introduce AI and LLMs into their
applications?

For more detailed information, you can read the [WCT-README.md](link-to-WCT-README.md). This
document contains comprehensive details about the WCT and links back to this introduction prompt
for further questions.

## Additional Information

The WCT also leverages the Semantic Kernel and the OpenAI API to provide advanced AI
capabilities. Setting up an account with OpenAI is relatively easy and cost-effective, allowing
developers to experiment with AI and LLMs without significant upfront investment. This makes it
accessible for developers to start integrating AI into their applications and explore the
potential benefits.

Thank you for your interest in the Windows Community Toolkit. We hope you find these tools
valuable and look forward to helping you modernize your WinForms applications.
