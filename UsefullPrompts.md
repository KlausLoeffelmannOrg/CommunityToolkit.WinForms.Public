Ask for XML:
============
Can you please add XML Comments to this class? 
Please also try to describe as best as possible the respective functionality in the remarks section, 
have the remarks tags always isolated and use paragraph tags inside the remarks.

Ask for Controls in Table Layout Panels:
=========================================
* Can you add a Radio Buttons to the TableLayoutPanel rows named "Extract code in Markdown code blocks automatically." 
  - Put this in a Panel, before you add it to the TableLayoutPanel since we want to add a checkbox "Automatically save the extracted listing/text files to the Conversation folder". 
  - This checkbox should only be enabled, when the option is selected. 
  - Add another checkbox which says "Store extracted conversation files in dedicated folders deren Name vom automatischen Titel der Konversation abgeleitet ist."

* Add another row with the Option "Select a folder for text-file/data extraction, only at thje time when the Conversation es erfordert".

* Store the extracted files automatically in MyDocuments under "\Chatty".
  - Also here, add the chekcbox (and so we need to add a Panel to the Layout Row) which says "Store extracted conversation files in dedicated folders deren Name vom automatischen Titel der Konversation abgeleitet ist."

In this prompt, I had a few typos and types things in Germn, because I could remember the english phrases. Please make sure, the captions of the  Radio- and CheckBox Buttons are verstaendlich und grammatikalisch korrekt.
